## General Info

### Ordering
I purchased the motorcycle from Alibaba. There seems to be at least 2 legit and verified sellers – CDSM and Gonped. My purchase was through CDSM (Changzhou Double Spring Machinery) as this seemed to be the most common seller. Apparently they’ve raised prices a little bit compared to others such as Gonped. The main page for CDSM is here; https://dobring2.en.alibaba.com, I messaged with Anne to confirm details and place the order.
Price/shipping I paid $5080 all-in, including shipping to my address for an ‘offroad’ version which includes 19/19 wheels, street legal kit (blinkers/lights/horn), a full VIN, USA charger, and a certificate of origin (CO) which I believe I can use to plate the bike.
